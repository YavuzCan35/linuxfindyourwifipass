# linuxfindyourwifipass

I use usb booted ubuntu to do some coding work for microcontrollers. Flashing with linux is easier sometimes then using 3rd party apps to flash in windows.
You dont remember your wifi password but you have a list of possible passwords. With this code, you can automatically try out all of them with the script, one by one and connect to wifi.
